discord theme that removes the top bar and the weird gap under the chat box
introduced in the latest discord UI update. Compatible with vencord and probably
betterdiscord and any other discord client that supports custom css.

doesn't change any colors, so it should be compatible with other themes as long
as they only change colors.

to install it download it and put it where themes go, i guess. or paste this
line somewhere:
```
@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milo256/discord-theme/refs/heads/master/theme.css")
```
